* Headers with * or ,*
Text text text
expand and collapse with TAB on header

** Lower level header with **. New line of same type with ,RET
** Like that
   Move blocks up and down with Alt-up / down

* Markup
  *bold* (asterisk) /italic/ (forward-slash) =verbatim= (equals) +strikethrough+ (plus)

 - bulleted list
 - list
 - items
  
 , i l insert link

 can link to files, emails, to-do items

  create 'header row' with |- TAB

| some | data           |

|   12 | buckly my shoe |
|   34 | shuth the door |
|      |                |

tab between cells

alt-up/down/left/right to reorder

LOTS of complexity here, can eval arbitrary elisp

* Export to other formats
  
, e e to get to menu buffer with options

iCal, HTML, Markdown

* Metadata with #+

#+TITLE: A gentle intro to Org-Mode
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Source code

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (range 10)
#+END_SRC

C-c ' to drop into a buffer which you can write code in
C-c C-c to execute
<s TAB inputs blocks as template

* LaTex

- Characters: \alpha \rightarrow \beta
- $O(n \log n)$

\begin{align*}
  3 * 2 + 1 &= 6 + 1\\
            &= 7
\end{align*}

* Literate programming

Evaluate all source blocks 

Cool thing, use org file as config and load it with 

~~(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/configuration.org")~~

in init.el which will evaulate all the code sequentially

babel is a plugin which goes through an org file and creates a source code file from it.

* Todo stuff

** TODO hit C-c C-t to mark something as done
** DONE Like this (actually cycles nothing, todo, done)
   CLOSED: [2020-03-01 Sun 17:37]
